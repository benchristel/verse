- make backspace work on chrome
- button and API to clear log
- some way to implement waitForCharOrTimeout - maybe an effect
  that simulates a keypress? Maybe a startSkippableAnimation effect?
- when a stack frame pops, call its renderer before destroying it,
  or some stuff might not get rendered

let animation = skippableAnimation(function*() => {

})

yield start(animation)
yield waitForChar()
yield skipToEnd(animation)
