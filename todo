# User feedback

- s/new tab/new window — instruct the user to right click
- explain nonsignificance of whitespace earlier

# BUGS

- disable Cmd+L "go to line number" hotkey - it's very
  surprising if you're expecting Cmd+L to focus the URL bar.
- disable "run" button when "can't run" is shown
- rewrite pico-fermi-bagel to work with the new API
- latent bug: once multiple files are supported, what will happen
  if some files have syntax errors when Verse first starts?
  How will those errors be reported to the user? One way of
  avoiding this is to only save files that eval successfully.

# HIGH-RISK FEATURES

- make buttons created by `yield options()` clickable

# UX CONCERNS

- provide a better means of hiding the display pane. startDisplay(() => [])
  should show the display but print nothing.
- display an error when the user creates one effect object
  but yields a different one (the most likely scenario is
  that they forgot to yield the first effect).
- display a warning when the user edits code with MemoryStorage
  active, telling them their changes won't be saved
- change "Run" to "Restart" while the program is running.
- clear the display and log when a program exits. Currently,
  it's hard to tell whether the program is still running.


# LOW-RISK FEATURES

- Timer wait()s should return a list of key events that
  happened while the program was waiting.
- button and API to clear log
- save/load
- create a `debug()` function that prints to the log and
  doesn't have to be yielded
- Add a big fat "play" icon in the center when nothing is running.
- Run app code in strict mode

# BREAKING CHANGES

- rename reducer to updater
