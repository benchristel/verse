# User feedback

- s/new tab/new window — instruct the user to right click
- explain nonsignificance of whitespace earlier

# BUGS

- deleting all the code does not make the output of displayText()
  go away—the function doesn't get undefined if there's no
  define() call.
- disable Cmd+L "go to line number" hotkey - it's very
  surprising if you're expecting Cmd+L to focus the URL bar.
- latent bug: once multiple files are supported, what will happen
  if some files have syntax errors when Verse first starts?
  How will those errors be reported to the user? One way of
  avoiding this is to only save files that eval successfully.

# UX CONCERNS

- provide a better means of hiding the display pane. startDisplay(() => [])
  should show the display but print nothing.
- clear the display and log when a program exits. Currently,
  it's hard to tell whether the program is still running.
- add restart button

# LOW-RISK FEATURES

- button and API to clear log
- save/load
- create a `debug()` function that prints to the log and
  doesn't have to be yielded
- Add a big fat "play" icon in the center when nothing is running.
- Run app code in strict mode

# BREAKING CHANGES

- rename reducer to updater
- remove waitForever

# REFACTORING

- move defaulting of reducer, getStateType to Store to
  fix duplication between Core and Simulator
