# Persistence User Scenarios

- A new user goes to the Verse site and downloads a blank Verse environment.
- After writing some code in a blank environment, a user saves their code.
- User writes an infinite loop and hangs the browser; after
  force-quitting and restarting, their changes (minus the
  infinite loop) are still there.
- User is working on a project and wants to start a new one.
  New project button exports a blank environment?
- User saves project history with Git.
- User edits code for a project they found on the web and
  shares their changes with the project maintainer
