Awesome! I'm so glad you've chosen Verse for learning to
program. Coding is (or can be, at least) one of the most
fun hobbies/careers out there, so I hope I can impart some
of that joy in these tutorials.

If you get stuck or have any questions as you work through
the examples and exercises, please email me at (my
name)@gmail.com and I'll do my best to help you out. My name
is the same as my Github username, which is in the URL of
this page (hopefully this little treasure hunt will prevent
me from getting too much email spam...)

# Supported Platforms

Before we get started, let's make sure you have the right
setup. Currently, Verse should work on the following
systems:

- Windows
- macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or newer

Additionally, you'll need the latest version of one of
these web browsers:

- Firefox
- Chrome

Support for more platforms (including mobile) is coming
soon, but for now it's just these. If there's a particular
OS or browser you think I should support, just email me.
If enough people ask for it, I'll figure out a way to
make it work.

# Tutorial: Hello, World!

Okay, you've installed an awesome web browser and you're
ready to code! Let's start with a classic used in
programming courses everywhere: the "Hello, World" program.
