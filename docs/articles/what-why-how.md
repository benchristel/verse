# Verse: Why? What? How?

## Why

Verse aspires to be useful to the general public, by
making it easy for anyone with a web browser to tinker with
code. However, I have to admit that that is not the main
reason I started working on Verse.

Verse was born out of psychological necessity. It's how I
keep myself sane in a software development universe that
seems to be ruled by chaos.

I am tired of writing crap.

This echoes a sentiment from Bob Martin, which he expressed
in the context of the software craft movement. To the
particular weariness he expressed, I add these others:

- I am tired of hearing the wailing and gnashing of teeth as
people struggle with with their "user-friendly" mobile
devices.
- I am tired of seeing people accept mediocre software as
an inevitable evil.
- I am tired of apologizing for my profession.
