# Verse Terms of Service

1. This document represents a binding contract between you
   and Verse.

2. By accessing and using Verse, you agree to be bound by
   these terms.

3. The Verse maintainers reserve the right to update these
   terms at any time and without prior notice by posting
   a new version at
   [https://benchristel.github.io/verse/tos](https://benchristel.github.io/verse/tos).
   Your use of Verse is subject to the most recent version
   of these terms.

4. You understand that all text, software, graphics or other
   data ("Content") are the sole property and responsibility
   of the originators of such content.
   This means that you, and not the Verse
   maintainers, are entirely responsible for all Content
   that you create, run, upload, post, transmit or
   otherwise make available via Verse or its
   associated community sites (including, but not limited
   to, Verse's Facebook and Github pages). Under no
   circumstances will Verse be liable in any way for any
   loss or damage resulting from the use of such Content.
   You understand in particular that code that you obtain
   from third parties may contain errors or malware, and you
   assume responsibility for the effects of any such code
   that you run on the Verse platform.

   Additionally, you agree not to use Verse to:

   1. create, upload, post, transmit, or otherwise make
      available any Content that is unlawful, harmful,
      threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory,
      libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or
      exploitative.
   2. impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your
      affiliation with a person or entity.
   3. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make
      available any Content that you do not have a right to
      make available under any law or under contractual or
      other relationships.
   4. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make
      available any Content that infringes any patent,
      trademark, trade secret, copyright or other
      proprietary rights of any party.
   5. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make
      available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising,
      promotional materials, "junk mail," "spam," or any
      other form of solicitation.
   6. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make
      available any Content that contains software viruses
      or any other computer code, files or programs designed
      to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of
      any computer software or hardware or
      telecommunications equipment, or to gain unauthorized
      access to data. This includes, but is not limited to,
      spyware, ransomware, and phishing attacks.
   7. interfere with or disrupt the Verse Service or servers
      or networks connected to the Verse Service, or disobey
      any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations
      of networks connected to the Verse Service.
   8. violate any applicable law.
   9. stalk or harass any person.
   10. collect or access other users' personal information.

   You acknowledge that Verse may or may not pre-screen
   Content, but that the Verse maintainers and their
   designees shall have the right (but not the obligation)
   in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, move, or
   remove any Content that is available via the Verse
   service or its associated community pages.

   You agree to bear all risks associated with the use of
   any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy,
   completeness, or usefulness of such Content.

5. **DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY**
   You agree to indemnify and hold Verse and its maintainers
   harmless from any claim or demand, including but not
   limited to reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third
   party due to or arising out of Content you execute,
   submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available
   through Verse, your use of Verse, your connection to
   Verse, your violation of these terms, or your violation
   of the rights of another.

6. You acknowledge that Verse reserves the right to modify
   or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Verse
   service or any part thereof without prior notice. You
   agree that Verse and the Verse maintainers shall not be
   liable for any modification, suspension, or
   discontinuance of services.

7. You agree that Verse reserves the right to terminate,
   restrict, or suspend your use of the Verse services or
   your participation in Verse's communities for violations
   of these terms, applicable law, or any other applicable
   agreements (including, but not limited to, codes of
   conduct).

8. Content available on Verse and its associated community
   sites may include links to other webpages. You
   acknowledge that Verse has no control over content on
   external pages and shall not be liable for any damage
   or loss caused by the use of or reliance on such content.

9. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY**
   The Verse software and services are provided "as is",
   without warranty of any kind, express or implied,
   including but not limited to the warranties of
   merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
   non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or
   copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or
   other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort,
   or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with
   Verse or the use of or other dealings in the Verse
   software.

   You expressly agree that Verse and its maintainers shall
   not be liable for any damages, including, but not limited
   to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or
   other intangible losses resulting from the use or the
   inability to use the Verse service, even if Verse has
   been advised of the possibility of such damages.

10. The failure of Verse to exercise any right or enforce
   any provision of these terms shall not constitute a
   waiver of such right or provision.

11. These terms constitute the entire agreement between you
   and Verse, superseding any prior agreements. If any
   provision of these terms is found by a court of competent
   jurisdiction to be invalid, you and Verse agree that the
   court should endeavor to give effect to the intention of
   the provision, and that the other provisions of these
   terms shall remain in full force and effect.
